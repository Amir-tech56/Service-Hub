Act as a senior full-stack developer and startup CTO.

Build a scalable MVP web platform similar to a local services marketplace (like freelance platforms but for real-world services).

Core Concept

A global digital marketplace that connects local service providers (cleaning, plumbing, electricity, moving, etc.) with clients looking for these services.

The platform must:

Work without a physical store

Be scalable internationally

Support multiple countries and cities

Take a commission per service

Technologies

Backend: Node.js + Express

Frontend: React (or Next.js)

Database: MongoDB

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Auth: simple email/phone (no complex auth for MVP)

Languages (IMPORTANT)

Implement full multilingual support with a language switcher:

Arabic (RTL support)

French

English

Use i18n best practices.

Countries & Locations

Include ALL countries of the world (use a countries dataset / API)

User flow:

Select country

Select city

Available services appear automatically

Services

For each country, allow these services (editable from admin):
